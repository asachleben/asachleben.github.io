I am committed to fostering an inclusive, discussion-based learning environment in which students are actively engaged and their perspectives are valued. My teaching aims to equip students with the skills to critically analyze and discuss the institutions, processes, and outcomes central to American politics. In Fall 2025, I served as instructor of record for POLI 200: The President, Congress, and Public Policy. I also served as a teaching assistant for POLI 100: American Democracy in Changing Times in Fall 2024, Spring 2025, and Spring 2026. In Spring 2025, I received the Richard R. Pouliot Teaching Award for excellence in graduate student teaching. I have also served as a teaching assisstant for my department's graduate methods summer program for incoming PhD students. In Fall 2026, I will be the teaching assistant for POLI 787: Advanced Topics in Political Data Science, the third course in UNC's graduate methods sequence.
