Welcome! I am a third-year PhD Candidate in the Department of Political Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I received my M.A. in Political Science from The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2025 and my B.A. in Political Science from Middlebury College in 2021. 

I study American political institutions with an emphasis on U.S. Congress. My research examines the intersection of elections, political communication, and legislative institutions in the United States. I am particularly interested in how electoral incentives shape the issues candidates emphasize in their campaigns and how campaign messaging and promises translate into legislative behavior once in office. I also explore how institutional structures within Congress interact with electoral dynamics to influence the origins and content of legislation. Broadly, my work aims to better understand the connections between voter preferences, political messaging, and legislative outcomes.
